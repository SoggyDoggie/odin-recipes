    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Risotto ranks right up there as one of the greatest dishes you can make with rice. Originating in Italy, risotto is a recipe made by simmering a starchy variety of rice in broth, with flavor-boosting ingredients added like onions, garlic, vegetables, meats, spices, herbs, and cheese. </p>
    <p>There are all kinds of tasty add-ins to risotto, and mushrooms are just one of them. Mushrooms add an earthy, savory flavor to risotto that makes it a good complement to main dishes like roast chicken, pork, or beef. You can serve mushroom risotto as a side dish, a main dish, or a starter to a multi-course Italian menu.</p>
